# Scroll Animation

https://thedanitor.github.io/scroll_animation/

This project is from the Day 6 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have heavily commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what each line of code does.


### Overall Impression

Pretty simple, effective project. It was very useful to learn about window.innerHeight and getBoundingClientRect.

### Things Learned
* nth-of-type(even) to select every other element matching selector
* window.innerHeight() returns viewport height
* .getBoundingClientRect() returns object which is smallest rectangle that includes element. Describes position and size with left, top, right, bottom, x, y, width, height.
